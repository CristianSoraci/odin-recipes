        <li>6 cups chicken broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>

    <p>Pasta ragu, classic italian with a spinoff on how the meat is cooked
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.2kg / 2.5 lb chuck beef</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil </li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic , minced</li>
        <li>1 onion , diced </li>
        <li>1 cup carrots , diced (Note 2)</li>
        <li>1 cup celery , diced (Note 2)</li>
        <li>800g / 28oz crushed canned tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 beef bouillon cubes , crumbled (Note 3) </li>
        <li>1 cup / 250ml red wine , full bodied (like merlot, cabernet sauvignon), or sub with beef broth/stock</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups / 375 ml water (Note 3)</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp dried thyme or 3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>3 dried bay leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <LI>Pat beef dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper</LI>
        <LI>Sear Beef: Heat 1 tbsp olive oil over high heat in a heavy based pot. Add beef and sear each piece aggressively on all sides until very browned (3 - 5 minutes in total), then remove onto a plate.</LI>
        <LI>Turn stove down to medium low and add remaining 2 tbsp of olive oil.</LI>
        <LI>Soffrito: Add garlic and onion and sauté for 2 minutes. Then add the carrots and celery and sauté slowly for 5 minutes.</LI>
        <LI>Add remaining Ragu ingredients and return the beef to the pot (including pooled juices). Turn the stove up and bring it to a simmer, then turn it down to low so it's bubbling very very gently. (Note 7)</LI>
        <LI>Slow cook: Cover the pot and let it cook for 2 hours or until beef is tender enough to shred. (Note 5 for slow cooker and pressure cooker).</LI>
        <LI>Shred: Remove beef then coarsely shred with 2 forks. Return beef to the pot. Simmer for 30 minutes until sauce is reduced and thickened - beef will soften slightly more during this step.</LI>
        <LI>Final season: Do a taste test and adjust the seasoning to your taste with salt and pepper. ALSO, add 1/2 tsp sugar if sauce is a bit sour for your taste (Note 6). Place the lid on and set aside until ready to serve (it's even better the next day and freezes well for months!).</LI>
